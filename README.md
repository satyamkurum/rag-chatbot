# RAG PDF Chatbot â€“ Ask Your PDF Anything!

A Streamlit-based chatbot that allows you to upload a PDF file and ask questions about its content. Built using:

-  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
-  Google Gemini (via `google-generativeai`)
-  Pinecone vector database
-  Streamlit for user interface

---

##  How It Works

1. Upload any PDF file
2. The app extracts and chunks the text
3. Each chunk is embedded using Gemini Embeddings
4. Chunks are stored in a temporary session namespace in Pinecone
5. When you ask a question:
   - It is embedded and matched to relevant chunks
   - The matched context is sent to Gemini (RAG)
   - You get an accurate, context-aware answer
6. Session data is automatically deleted when you're done
